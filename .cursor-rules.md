# Cursor AI Rules

## Project Structure
- Frontend code is in Zig and compiles to WASM and used Emscripten
- Backend code is in Python using AWS Lambda
- Keep frontend and backend code separate
- Use consistent naming conventions:
  - Frontend: camelCase for variables, PascalCase for types
  - Backend: snake_case for Python code
- Backend for a new lambda need their changes propagated to deployment scripts and infrastructure like cloudformation in order to fully manifest
- Frontend changes invovling interoperability with javascript should have all logic occur in Zig

## Code Style
- Use 4 spaces for indentation in Python
- Use 4 spaces for indentation in Zig
- Keep line length under 100 characters
- Add docstrings to all Python functions
- Add comments to complex Zig code
- Add comments to any 3rd party API use

## Git Practices
- Commit messages should be clear and descriptive
- Use conventional commits format:
  - feat: for new features
  - fix: for bug fixes
  - docs: for documentation
  - refactor: for code refactoring
  - test: for adding tests

## Testing
- Write tests for all Python backend functions
- Test WASM compilation for frontend changes
- Include error handling in all API endpoints

## Documentation
- Keep README.md up to date
- Document all API endpoints
- Include setup instructions for new dependencies

## Security
- Never commit API keys or secrets
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Validate all user input
- Sanitize all database queries

## Performance
- Optimize WASM bundle size
- Use efficient DynamoDB queries
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Monitor Lambda execution times

## Accessibility
- Ensure frontend is keyboard navigable
- Include ARIA labels where needed
- Maintain good color contrast
- Support screen readers

## Error Handling
- Provide clear error messages
- Log errors appropriately
- Handle edge cases gracefully
- Include fallback behaviors 

## Backend Architecture

The backend infrastructure for TruthByte is managed through AWS CloudFormation templates and follows a serverless architecture pattern.

### Lambda Functions

The following Lambda functions handle core application logic:
- `get-token`: Handles user authentication and JWT issuance
- `auth-ping`: Validates JWT tokens and session status
- `fetch-questions`: Retrieves questions for users
- `submit-answers`: Processes user answer submissions
- `propose-question`: Handles new question submissions
- `get-user`: Retrieves user profile data
- `get-categories`: Returns available question categories
- `get-user-submissions`: Fetches a user's submitted questions
- `approve-question`: Handles question approval workflow

Each Lambda function:
- Uses Python 3.13 runtime
- Has dedicated IAM role with least-privilege permissions
- Includes shared auth utilities from backend/shared/
- Follows consistent error handling patterns
- Uses environment variables for configuration

### DynamoDB Tables

Core data storage uses the following DynamoDB tables:
- `truthbyte-questions`: Stores question content and metadata
- `truthbyte-answers`: Records user answer submissions
- `truthbyte-sessions`: Manages user sessions
- `truthbyte-users`: Stores user profiles
- `truthbyte-question-categories`: Manages question categorization

### API Gateway Configuration

REST API endpoints are exposed through API Gateway:
- Regional endpoint configuration
- CORS enabled for frontend domain
- Rate limiting/throttling protection
- Custom domain mapping via CloudFront
- JWT authorization on protected routes

### Deployment Infrastructure

Deployment resources are organized as:

## Auth Rules

- All Lambda handlers must check for a valid JWT in the `Authorization` header.
- JWTs are issued using `create_token(session_id: str)` and verified with `verify_token(token: str)` in `auth_utils.py`.
- Use `os.environ["JWT_SECRET"]` for signing.
- Unauthorized requests return `401 Unauthorized`.
- Tokens expire after 12 hours.
