# TruthByte

A minimal Zig+WASM game that crowdsources human truth judgments to build better LLM evaluation datasets. Play a fast round of "True or False?" â€” every answer trains the future.

## Proof of Concept

### Core Assumptions

- All questions have a canonical "true" answer known to the system
- Users answer batches of questions (maybe 5â€“10)
- Each session is tagged with simple metadata (IP hash, timestamp, optional fingerprint)
- A User's trust score is calculated but doesn't block interaction yet
- Users can optionally submit questions for potential inclusion

### System Components

ðŸ”µ **Frontend (WASM/Zig)**

- Renders a list of questions (statement + answer options) with associated tags for categorization (e.g., food, video games, Python, books).

- Tracks response times per question

- Posts results back to the backend with basic metadata

- Offers an optional "Submit your own question" flow

ðŸŸ¢ **Backend (Lambda)**
- GET /questions â†’ returns a randomized batch of canary questions, optionally filtered by tags

- POST /answers â†’ receives user answers + timing, computes trust score, and sends telemetry data to Honeycomb using OpenTelemetry

- POST /submit-question â†’ saves user-submitted questions to a "pending" pool (S3, DynamoDB, or plain JSON)

- Integrates OpenTelemetry to monitor backend performance and send traces and metrics to Honeycomb

ðŸŸ£ **Admin (you)**
- Can manually review pending questions and promote them to the main question set (or not)

- No moderation dashboard needed for now â€” just promote new questions manually

### Data Flow Summary
```
User â†’ Frontend (WASM) â†’ GET /questions
                           â†‘
     â†“ answers w/ timing  â†’ POST /answers
     â†“ new question       â†’ POST /submit-question
```

### Example Data Structures

#### Questions

```json
{
  "id": "q123",
  "text": "The moon is made of cheese.",
  "answer": false,
  "tags": ["science", "myth"]
}
```

#### User Submission

```json
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "responses": [
    { "question_id": "q123", "answer": false, "duration": 3.2 },
    { "question_id": "q456", "answer": true,  "duration": 1.7 }
  ],
  "timestamp": 1685939231,
  "ip_hash": "84d5ae...",
  "user_agent": "wasm-frontend-1"
}
```

#### User Question Submission

```json
{
  "text": "Water boils at 100Â°C at sea level.",
  "answer": true,
  "tags": ["science", "physics"],
  "submitted_at": 1685939231
}
```
