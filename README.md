# TruthByte

A minimal Zig+WASM game that crowdsources human truth judgments to build better LLM evaluation datasets. Play a fast round of "True or False?" â€” every answer trains the future.

## Proof of Concept

### Core Assumptions

- All questions have a canonical "true" answer known to the system
- Users answer batches of questions (maybe 5â€“10)
- Each session is tagged with simple metadata (IP hash, timestamp, optional fingerprint)
- A User's trust score is calculated but doesn't block interaction yet
- Users can optionally submit questions for potential inclusion

### System Components

ðŸŸ¢ **Frontend (WASM/Zig) â€” Working**

- Compiles to WASM and renders the quiz UI in the browser
- Loads questions, displays passages, and tracks response times per question
- Makes API calls to the backend for fetching questions and submitting answers (API endpoints are stubs and pending)
- User session tracking is planned (currently commented out)
- Optional "Submit your own question" flow is planned

ðŸŸ¡ **Backend (Zig) â€” In Progress**

- Project initialized (`zig init`), but endpoints are not yet implemented
- Will provide:
  - `GET /questions` â†’ returns a randomized batch of questions, optionally filtered by tags
  - `POST /answers` â†’ receives user answers + timing, computes trust score, and sends telemetry data
  - `POST /submit-question` â†’ saves user-submitted questions to a pending pool
  - `POST /suggest-tags` and `POST /remove-tags` â†’ endpoints for suggesting tag additions/removals (planned)
- Will integrate OpenTelemetry and support S3/DynamoDB/JSON storage (planned)

ðŸŸ  **Admin (Manual Review) â€” Manual Process**

- No moderation dashboard yet
- To promote a question: manually move it from the pending pool to the main question set (e.g., by editing a JSON file or running a script)
- To reject a question: manually delete or archive it from the pending pool
- Tag suggestions and removals are handled by backend endpoints (planned), but can also be done by editing the data files directly

### Data Flow Summary
```
User â†’ Frontend (WASM) â†’ GET /questions
                           â†‘
     â†“ answers w/ timing  â†’ POST /answers
     â†“ new question       â†’ POST /submit-question
```

### Example Data Structures

#### Questions

```json
{
  "id": "q003",
  "tags": ["health"],
  "question": "is pain experienced in a missing body part or paralyzed area",
  "title": "Phantom pain",
  "passage": "Phantom pain sensations are described as perceptions that an individual experiences relating to a limb or an organ that is not physically part of the body. Limb loss is a result of either removal by amputation or congenital limb deficiency. However, phantom limb sensations can also occur following nerve avulsion or spinal cord injury.",
  "answer": true
}
```

#### User Submission

```json
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "responses": [
    { "question_id": "q123", "answer": false, "duration": 3.2 },
    { "question_id": "q456", "answer": true,  "duration": 1.7 }
  ],
  "timestamp": 1685939231,
  "ip_hash": "84d5ae...",
  "user_agent": "wasm-frontend-1"
}
```

#### User Question Submission

```json
{
  "text": "Water boils at 100Â°C at sea level.",
  "answer": true,
  "tags": ["science", "physics"],
  "submitted_at": 1685939231
}
```
