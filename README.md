# TruthByte

A minimal Zig+WASM game that crowdsources human truth judgments to build better LLM evaluation datasets. Play a fast round of "True or False?" â€” every answer trains the future.

## Quick Start

1. **Clone and Setup**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/truthbyte.git
cd truthbyte
```

2. **Install Prerequisites**:
- Zig (0.14.0+)
- Python 3.13.5+
- EMSDK (for WASM)

3. **Set EMSDK**:
```bash
# Windows PowerShell
$env:EMSDK="C:\path\to\emsdk"

# Unix/macOS
export EMSDK=/path/to/emsdk
```

4. **Run Frontend**:
```bash
cd frontend
zig build -Dtarget=wasm32-emscripten run
```

For detailed setup instructions, see the [Development Guide](#development-guide).

## Project Overview

### Core Assumptions

- All questions have a canonical "true" answer known to the system
- Users answer batches of questions (maybe 5â€“10)
- Each session is tagged with simple metadata (IP hash, timestamp, optional fingerprint)
- A User's trust score is calculated but doesn't block interaction yet
- Users can optionally submit questions for potential inclusion

### System Components

ðŸŸ¢ **Frontend (WASM/Zig) â€” Working**
- Compiles to WASM and renders the quiz UI in the browser
- Loads questions, displays passages, and tracks response times per question
- Makes API calls to the backend for fetching questions and submitting answers
- User session tracking is planned (currently commented out)
- Optional "Submit your own question" flow is planned

ðŸŸ¡ **Backend (Python) â€” In Progress**
- Project initialized, endpoints pending implementation
- Provides:
  - `GET /fetch-questions` â†’ returns a randomized batch of questions, optionally filtered by tags
  - `POST /answers` â†’ receives user answers + timing, computes trust score
  - `POST /submit-question` â†’ saves user-submitted questions to a pending pool
  - `POST /suggest-tags` and `POST /remove-tags` â†’ tag management endpoints (planned)
- Will integrate OpenTelemetry and support S3/DynamoDB/JSON storage

ðŸŸ  **Admin (Manual Review) â€” Manual Process**
- No moderation dashboard yet
- Manual question promotion/rejection process
- Tag management through backend endpoints or direct data file edits

### Data Flow

```
User â†’ Frontend (WASM) â†’ GET /questions
                           â†‘
     â†“ answers w/ timing  â†’ POST /answers
     â†“ new question       â†’ POST /submit-question
```

## Development Guide

### Prerequisites

- Zig (latest, or 0.14.0+)
- Python 3.13.5+ (for backend)
- Emscripten SDK (EMSDK) for WASM compilation

### Environment Setup

#### EMSDK Installation

1. Clone the Emscripten SDK:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git
cd emsdk
```

2. Install and activate the latest version:
```bash
# Windows
./emsdk.bat install latest
./emsdk.bat activate latest

# Unix/macOS
./emsdk install latest
./emsdk activate latest
```

#### Environment Variables

1. **Temporary Setup**:
```bash
# Windows PowerShell
$env:EMSDK="path/to/your/emsdk"  # e.g., "C:\code\git\emsdk"

# Windows CMD
set EMSDK=path/to/your/emsdk

# Unix/macOS
export EMSDK=/path/to/your/emsdk
```

2. **Permanent Setup**:

Windows:
1. Open System Properties (Win + Break)
2. Click "Environment Variables"
3. Under "System Variables", click "New"
4. Variable name: `EMSDK`
5. Variable value: Your EMSDK path (e.g., `C:\path\to\emsdk`)

macOS/Linux:
Add to your shell's startup file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):
```bash
export EMSDK=/path/to/your/emsdk
export PATH=$EMSDK:$PATH
```

3. **Verify Setup**:
```bash
# Should print your EMSDK path
echo %EMSDK%  # Windows CMD
echo $EMSDK   # PowerShell/Unix

# Should show emcc version
emcc --version
```

### Building and Running

#### Frontend (WASM)
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Build and run the WASM target:
```bash
zig build -Dtarget=wasm32-emscripten run
```

This will:
- Compile the Zig code to WebAssembly
- Start a local development server
- Open your default browser to the application
- Enable hot-reloading for development

If you encounter the error `EMSDK environment variable not found`, ensure you've set up the EMSDK environment variable as described above.

## Data Structures

### Questions

```json
{
  "id": "q003",
  "tags": ["health"],
  "question": "is pain experienced in a missing body part or paralyzed area",
  "title": "Phantom pain",
  "passage": "Phantom pain sensations are described as perceptions that an individual experiences relating to a limb or an organ that is not physically part of the body. Limb loss is a result of either removal by amputation or congenital limb deficiency. However, phantom limb sensations can also occur following nerve avulsion or spinal cord injury.",
  "answer": true
}
```

### User Submission

```json

## Technical Details

### Repo Template

This project uses a template from [zig-raylib-wasm-hot-template](https://github.com/Lommix/zig-raylib-wasm-hot-template) for zig + raylib + wasm integration.

### Data Sources
