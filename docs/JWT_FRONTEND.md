# JWT Frontend Integration Summary

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### 1. **New Authentication State**
- Added `Authenticating` state to `GameStateEnum`
- Added `auth_initialized: bool` flag to track authentication status
- Updated initial state from `Loading` to `Authenticating`

### 2. **Authentication Flow Integration**
- **`startAuthentication()`**: Initiates JWT token fetch from `/session` endpoint
- **`on_auth_complete()`**: Callback that handles authentication success/failure
- **Authentication-first flow**: App now authenticates before loading questions

### 3. **JavaScript Interface Extensions**
- Added `init_auth()` extern function declaration
- Added `auth_ping()` extern function for debugging
- Implemented stub versions for native builds

### 4. **Enhanced User Experience**
- **Loading messages**: "Connecting to server..." → "Loading questions..."
- **Fallback handling**: Graceful degradation when auth fails
- **Visual feedback**: Same loading animation for auth and question loading

### 5. **Debug Features**
- **Press 'P' key**: Test authentication with ping endpoint
- **Console logging**: Detailed auth status and token validation info
- **Real token usage**: Session and token data now uses actual JWT values

### 6. **Updated Game Flow**
```
App Start → Authentication → Question Loading → Game Play
     ↓              ↓               ↓              ↓
Authenticating → Loading → Answering → [Submitting/Finished]
```

## 🔧 How Authentication Works

### Initial Startup:
1. **State**: Game starts in `Authenticating` state
2. **Call**: `startAuthentication()` calls `js.init_auth(on_auth_complete)`
3. **JavaScript**: Fetches JWT token from `/session` endpoint
4. **Response**: `on_auth_complete()` processes the result

### Success Path:
- ✅ Authentication succeeds
- 🎯 Sets `auth_initialized = true`
- 📋 Calls `startUserDataFetch()` to load user data
- 🎮 Game proceeds with authenticated API calls

### Failure Path:
- ❌ Authentication fails
- 🔄 Sets `auth_initialized = false`
- 📋 Initializes offline state:
  - Resets streak counters
  - Sets daily_completed_today = false
  - Enables offline daily mode
- 🎮 Game continues in offline mode with local features

### Timeout Handling:
- ⏱️ 10-second connection timeout
- 📢 Progressive status messages:
  - 0-5s: "Connecting to server..."
  - 5-10s: "Still connecting..."
  - >10s: "Connection timeout. Using offline mode."
- 👆 Manual skip available after 8 seconds (tap anywhere)
- 🔄 Automatic fallback to offline mode after timeout

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### 1. **Build and Deploy Frontend**
```bash
cd frontend
zig build
# Deploy to your web server
```

### 2. **Monitor Browser Console**
You should see authentication flow logs:
```
🔍 Testing authentication with ping...
✅ Authentication successful!
✅ Auth ping successful: {"valid": true, "payload": {...}}
```

### 3. **Test Authentication States**

#### **Successful Authentication:**
- App shows "Connecting to server..." briefly
- Then "Loading questions..." 
- Questions load from API with JWT tokens

#### **Failed Authentication:**
- App shows "Authentication failed. Using offline mode."
- Falls back to hardcoded question pool
- Game still fully playable

### 4. **Debug Commands**
- **Press 'P'**: Test JWT token validation (when authenticated)
- Check browser console for ping response details

### 5. **Network Inspection**
Open browser dev tools → Network tab:
- **`/session`**: Should return JWT token
  - Success: 200 OK with token
  - Failure: 401/403 triggers offline mode
  - Timeout: No response triggers offline mode
- **`/fetch-questions`**: Should include `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
  - Success: 200 OK with questions
  - Failure: Falls back to offline pool
- **`/ping`**: Should validate token when pressing 'P'
  - Success: {"valid": true, "payload": {...}}
  - Invalid token: Triggers re-authentication

## 🔍 Verification Checklist

- [ ] App starts with "Connecting to server..." message
- [ ] Browser console shows "✅ Authentication successful!"
- [ ] Network requests include JWT `Authorization` headers
- [ ] Questions load from API (not fallback pool)
- [ ] Pressing 'P' shows auth ping results in console
- [ ] Game functions normally after authentication

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **Issue**: "Authentication failed" message
- **Check**: Backend JWT_SECRET environment variable is set
- **Check**: `/session` endpoint is deployed and accessible
- **Check**: CORS headers allow your frontend domain
- **Resolution**: 
  - App continues in offline mode
  - All features available with local data
  - Re-authentication attempted on next startup

### **Issue**: Questions still use fallback pool
- **Check**: `/fetch-questions` endpoint requires authentication
- **Check**: JWT tokens are being sent in requests
- **Check**: Backend can verify JWT signatures
- **Resolution**:
  - Verify network requests in browser dev tools
  - Check token expiration
  - Confirm backend logs for auth errors

### **Issue**: "Auth ping failed" when pressing 'P'
- **Check**: `/ping` endpoint is deployed
- **Check**: JWT token is valid and not expired
- **Check**: Backend JWT verification is working
- **Resolution**:
  - Check browser console for token details
  - Verify backend logs for validation errors
  - Test endpoint directly with valid token

## 📊 Expected API Flow

```
1. GET /session
   Response: 
   Success: {"token": "eyJ...", "session_id": "demo-session-123"}
   Failure: 401/403 or timeout → offline mode

2. GET /fetch-questions 
   Headers: Authorization: Bearer eyJ...
   Response:
   Success: {"questions": [...], "count": 7}
   Failure: Use offline question pool

3. GET /ping (debug)
   Headers: Authorization: Bearer eyJ...
   Response:
   Success: {"valid": true, "payload": {"session_id": "...", "exp": ...}}
   Failure: {"valid": false, "error": "..."}
```

## 🔐 Offline Mode Details

When authentication fails or times out, the frontend gracefully degrades to offline mode:

### Available Features
- ✅ All game modes (with local data)
- ✅ Score tracking
- ✅ Daily challenges
- ✅ Category filtering
- ❌ Online leaderboards
- ❌ Streak synchronization
- ❌ Cross-device progress

### Data Management
- 📝 Uses local storage for persistence
- 🔄 Maintains offline progress
- 💾 Caches frequently used data
- 🔒 Preserves user preferences

### Recovery
- 🔄 Attempts re-authentication on next startup
- 📱 Syncs data when connection restored
- 🔐 Preserves offline progress after sync

## 🎉 Ready to Test!

Your TruthByte frontend now has full JWT authentication integration! The app will automatically authenticate with your backend and use secure API calls throughout the game experience. 🔐✨
