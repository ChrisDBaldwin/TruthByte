# scripts/

This directory contains utility scripts for preprocessing and analyzing data:

- `add_id_and_tags.py`: Adds UUIDs and tag metadata to raw question data.
- `analyze_data.py`: Aggregates and summarizes question dataset.
- `review_keywords.py`: Aids in tag curation based on keyword frequency.

These scripts expect inputs from `/data` and may write processed files back into that directory.
